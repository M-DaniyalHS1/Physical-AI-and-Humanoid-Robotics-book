chore(project): remove unused files and clean up project structure

- Removed empty directories that were cluttering the project
- Deleted test and verification files that were development artifacts
- Removed unused utility files from backend
- Cleaned up unused frontend test file
- Removed unused image asset

These files were identified as unused, redundant, or development artifacts 
that were cluttering the project structure. Removing them improves project 
maintainability and reduces confusion for developers.

No impact on core functionality - all essential files remain intact.

Files affected:
- Deleted empty directories: -p (both root and frontend)
- Deleted test files: test_* and verify_* files
- Deleted backend utilities: comprehensive_content_test.py, minimal_app.py, etc.
- Deleted frontend test: test_import.mjs
- Deleted unused asset: robot-isolated-png-with-transparent-background_68880-69293.png
