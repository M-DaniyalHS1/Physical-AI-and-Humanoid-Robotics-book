# Introduction to ROS 2

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot software. It is the successor to ROS (Robot Operating System), offering improved architecture, security, and real-time capabilities.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is designed to be the standard development platform for robotics applications. It provides:
- A flexible framework for writing robot software
- Tools for debugging, testing, and visualizing robot behavior
- Reusable components for common robot functionality
- A rich ecosystem of existing packages for various robot types

## Key Features of ROS 2

- **Middleware**: Uses Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication
- **Real-time support**: Enables real-time processing of robot data
- **Security**: Built-in security framework for safe robot operation
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Language support**: Python, C++, and other languages
- **Distributed architecture**: Allows multiple machines to work together

## Why Use ROS 2 for Physical AI?

ROS 2 serves as the foundation for connecting digital AI with physical robots. It provides the middleware that allows AI algorithms to interact with robot hardware, sensors, and actuators.

In the context of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2 acts as the communication layer that connects perception, reasoning, and action components.
